# Application Todo List

This document lists applications that could be considered for addition to the homelab deployment. Applications are categorized by function and include both popular self-hosted applications and infrastructure components commonly used in homelab environments.

## Application Status Legend

- ✅ **Deployed** - Currently running in the cluster
- 🔄 **Planned** - Identified for future deployment
- ⚠️ **Under Review** - Requires further evaluation
- ❌ **Not Suitable** - Determined to be incompatible or unnecessary
- 🚧 **In Progress** - Currently being implemented
- ⏸️ **Blocked** - Implementation blocked by dependencies or issues

## Priority Levels

- **High** - Essential functionality, high impact, should be implemented soon
- **Medium** - Useful functionality, moderate impact, implement when resources allow
- **Low** - Nice to have, low impact, implement if time permits

## Work Estimation Guide

- **Hours**: Estimated implementation time (research + development + testing + documentation)
- **Complexity**: Technical complexity (High/Medium/Low)
- **Dependencies**: Prerequisites that must be completed first

## Implementation Notes

### Resource Requirements

- **High GPU Applications**: Stable Diffusion, ComfyUI require significant GPU resources
- **Database Heavy**: PostgreSQL, Redis should be implemented early as dependencies
- **Storage Intensive**: Media applications, photo management require substantial storage

### Dependencies

- **Authentication**: Implement Authelia or Authentik early for SSO across applications
- **Monitoring Stack**: Prometheus + Grafana + Loki should be deployed together
- **Media Stack**: Prowlarr → Sonarr/Radarr → Plex/Jellyfin → Overseerr workflow

### Security Considerations

- All applications should integrate with central authentication (SSO)
- Network policies should be implemented for inter-pod communication
- Regular security updates and vulnerability scanning
- Backup strategies for all persistent data

### Deployment Strategy

1. **Phase 1 (Core Infrastructure)**: PostgreSQL, Redis, Vault, Cert Manager
2. **Phase 2 (Monitoring)**: Prometheus, Grafana, Uptime Kuma
3. **Phase 3 (Authentication)**: Authelia/Authentik, SSO integration
4. **Phase 4 (Applications)**: Deploy based on priority and dependencies
