## Implementation Notes

### Resource Requirements

- **High GPU Applications**: Stable Diffusion, ComfyUI require significant GPU resources
- **Database Heavy**: PostgreSQL, Redis should be implemented early as dependencies
- **Storage Intensive**: Media applications, photo management require substantial storage

### Dependencies

- **Authentication**: Implement Authelia or Authentik early for SSO across applications
- **Monitoring Stack**: Prometheus + Grafana + Loki should be deployed together
- **Media Stack**: Prowlarr → Sonarr/Radarr → Plex/Jellyfin → Overseerr workflow

### Security Considerations

- All applications should integrate with central authentication (SSO)
- Network policies should be implemented for inter-pod communication
- Regular security updates and vulnerability scanning
- Backup strategies for all persistent data

### Deployment Strategy

1. **Phase 1 (Core Infrastructure)**: PostgreSQL, Redis, Vault, Cert Manager
2. **Phase 2 (Monitoring)**: Prometheus, Grafana, Uptime Kuma
3. **Phase 3 (Authentication)**: Authelia/Authentik, SSO integration
4. **Phase 4 (Applications)**: Deploy based on priority and dependencies
